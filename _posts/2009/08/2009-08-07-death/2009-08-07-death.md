 And if that wasn't enough, on Wednesday evening putting the chooks to bed we found their house was crawling with "red mite". It's a common pest of wild birds - 1mm long red bugs that feed on the chickens' blood. We'd checked the cube at the weekend and there was nothing wrong at all - so the infestion had come from nothing to "intense" within a few short days. There must have been tens of thousands of the bugs all over the chickens and their house. Cue a full 24 hour project to powder the chickens, persuade them to sleep outside away from the "biters", a full strip down clean of the cage and disinfect with Jayes fluid and Ant powder and the purchase of a number of remedy and barrier products to ensure they can't get reinfected in the future. We need you to appreciate those eggs - a lot of love it takes.
