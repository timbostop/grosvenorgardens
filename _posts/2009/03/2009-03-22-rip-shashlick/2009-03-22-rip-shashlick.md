We had a bit of a shock Saturday when we discovered poor old Shash, a not-even-one-year-old chicken and much loved by all, had died and was laying on her side under the Eglu. Chickens are such funny pets and you get quickly attached to their quirky characters. Shash (aka Chicken Shashlick) was grey, soft, larger-than-the-others, always clean, very nicely tempered and liked a cuddle. She will be much missed and has changed the dynamic of the hen coop for the worse. Without feeling too sentimental, we had been planned to add a couple more birds to the coop and so we visited our friendly breeder and returned with 3 lovely new POL hens. Two ginger (ISA Browns) and one, like Shash, a Belle Blue. Continuing the Indian theme we have Kulfi (following Shashlick), Shilpa (as in Shetty, the pretty one) and Twizzle on account of a cross-beak. All hell broke loose when we tried to introduce the infidels into the 2 confused inhabitants left behind. I'm not sure they missed Shash, but they certainly didn't like the 3 new tennants moving in. Cue much fussing, pecking, squabbling and fighting. Most of which we had to break up. Bossy Boo had to spend the night in the "cooler" (box in the kitchen) after disgracing herself with the new ones. But tonight we somehow managed to get them settled down. It's a bit like raising children this game. Anyway, we miss you Shash. Long live the 5 new Hens at Sheen Poultry!
