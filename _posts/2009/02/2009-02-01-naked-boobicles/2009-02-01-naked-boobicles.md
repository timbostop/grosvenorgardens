We have a problem. Maddie and Boo have been plucking their breast feathers out. We're not sure why. Maybe they're making themselves ready for the basting oil and sage & onion stuffing. Apparently, chickens do this when they're broody - when they're incubating eggs it helps if their warm skin can make direct contact with the egg and keep it at the right temperature. They can also do this when they're bored or when they're moulting. We hope neither of these are true. Anyway, we're keeping an eye on them and spraying them with "anti-peck spray". Spoilt little brats. Hopefully the feathers will return soon since we're in the coldest winter in 13 years (i am reliably informed)
