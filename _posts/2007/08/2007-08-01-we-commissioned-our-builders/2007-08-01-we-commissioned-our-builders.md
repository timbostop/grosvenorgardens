We made our choice and have commissioned LoftRooms as our builder for the big renovation project. They're busy and won't start on site until mid-September. Hopefully the planning, surveying and drawing process will start in the next few days - that's the longest straw. So the waiting game begins. And meanwhile, as if to make us immediately wary, we saw a friends house who has had a shocker with her builders - they've done some very poor quality work and are refusing to fix it. In other news we saw the beautiful house of S and A in Cambridge - they are having similar volume of work done - loft, rear extension and refurb and have done a great job. So all of which makes us want to plan, design and plan before any work begins. Watch this space
