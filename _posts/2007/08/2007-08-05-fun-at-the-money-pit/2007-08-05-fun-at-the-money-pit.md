*Unfortunately, some images from this post are missing - they were sadly lost during the blog migration.*

So our house comes with some nice things and some fairly horrible things. We went there this morning to measure up properly and take photos of everything for the "before" pictures.

But we found some things we weren't expecting! Behind an old battered looking cupboard, full of betamax videos, we found what at first we thought was a postbox with the word Lambeth on it, but it turned out to be the original Victorian (or is it Edwardian?) cast-iron range cooker. This is one period feature we won't be keeping in the house, but perhaps someone on eBay might want it. Amazing!

Also, behind a horrible 70's electric bar fire, was another original fireplace, in need of some love.
