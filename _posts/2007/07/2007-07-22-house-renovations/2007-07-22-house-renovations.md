We are now the proud owners of a house (well, shed). A shed which needs months of work to make it habitable but one which we will one day be very proud of. Amazingly (and in contrast to my previous experience) buying this house was pretty much painfree - this was mostly because we knew up front that buying it would be like opening our wallets and emptying the contents every day forever - so we put caution to the wind and worried not about tiny details. Actually it's structurally sound - it just needs a lot of "internal modernisation" - and since we plan to do everything to it - it's current state was unimportant. So now we're holding talent shows for builders - so we can pick the right man for the job. The list of work is long: rewiring, replumbing, new boiler, new central heating, plastering throughout, wood stripping throughout, new windows, loft extension, kitchen extension, new patio doors, new bathroom, new kitchen, new flooring, new tiles, refurbishment of fireplaces etc etc This is the kind of thing we're hoping to achieve within: ![kitchen.jpg](images/kitchen.jpg) Walking into the place on Thursday we felt a mixture of relief, intrepidation and joy - there was a bit of jumping around on the dirty carpets and peering into old drawers, still containing a few trinkets from their previous, now-dead owner - but mostly we went around bashing things with a hammer to see if there were "period features" behind. We found two original fireplaces, in the front and rear bedrooms, long since boarded up with cheap 1960s wallpaper on hardboard - and other places where the fireplace had been completely removed. It's going to be an adventure.
