Since we're at the start of our renovations of our house, here's some advice taken from [http://www.how2pull.co.uk/](http://www.how2pull.co.uk/)

> Always get at least three quotes and insist on paying against specific jobs completed to your satisfaction. \[Yup, we did this\] Always check past workmanship. \[We phoned previous clients\] Trusting a single-line quote is a recipe for disaster. Quotes should be detailed. Break the job into logical components. \[We were told to be aware of this from our friends\]
