Since I last wrote we've been away from holiday but progress has been swift. He's an update:

- Boiler - we have one and it's warming the house. It's great to have the place warming up and gently drying out
- Utility room - the first cupboards are in and despite a sink being the wrong side, it's starting to take shape
- Flooring - probably the biggest improvement, the oak flooring is down in the hall, downstairs loo and most of the lounge and dining room - looks really fab, just hope we can protect it enough until all the heavy work is done
- Windows arrived - and they look great. They've been prefabricated off site and are already first-coat painted which saves them from the winter weather. I can't wait to see them in.
- Doors and handles on - looks great
- Lounge fireplace is in - really grand, it's the original one from the rear dining room with a refurbished grate, and a new black slate hearth.
- Dining room secured and almost complete
- Bathroom calamities - we need to make some changes to the bathroom layout cause we cocked up - more later...

<!-- Broken image reference:
The original fireplace from the rear dining room is now reinstated rather grandly in the lounge (needs cleaning): ![](images/photo-canon 002.jpg) The brick feature in the dining room looks good - although we're getting rid of the dodgy brick hearth which didn't turn out as planned ![](images/photo-canon 003.jpg) New doors between the lounge and dining room: ![](images/photo-canon 004.jpg) Dining room door into kitchen, just waiting for the extension to be built... ![](images/photo-canon 005.jpg) Refurbished original fireplace - it's going to have a gas fired coal-effect fire installed in due course ![](images/photo-canon 006.jpg) Door handles now on: ![](images/photo-canon 007.jpg) Utility room starts to take shape: ![](images/photo-canon 008.jpg) Nice detail in the cupboards - that's hard to do right: ![](images/photo-canon 011.jpg) Storage cupboard from Ikea: ![](images/photo-canon 012.jpg) Bathroom, we have some changes to make here: ![](images/photo-canon 014.jpg) ![](images/photo-canon 015.jpg) Door frames are on - ![](images/photo-canon 020.jpg) We've got a bunny boiler in our house ![](images/photo-canon 023.jpg) The house is warm now and the plaster is drying out ![](images/photo-canon 024.jpg)
