Thought it would be worth a quick update. The builders are on their two week break - which is a blessing for the neighbours but also a well-earned rest for us too. At least it gives us two weeks to "get ahead" of them again. The decisions, plans, requirements and designs required to keep them moving is quite exhausting sometimes. We had a bit of a confrontation at the end - we didn't want to pay them all they thought was due. Mainly because we've been taught to hold back at least 10% of the total cost until completion and the payment schedule didn't really match that. So the chaps had to go away with half what they wanted - but hopefully it'll mean they return keen to win back the last bit in January. This aint no charity. The good news is there's only a couple of weeks of work left by the Polish crew (although some of that will be at the end). The major items are:

- Kitchen installation (cupboards, electrics, water, gas)
- Replace skirting boards
- Fix/repair cornicing/coving
- Replace/repair dado rail (architrave)
- Prepare all the old gloss wood for painting
- Sand all the fireplaces
- Complete window installation (two bays)
- Patio doors (remove, supply new and install, including lintel over)
- Complete utility room (sink + worktop)
- Label all electrical wires
- Commission electrics
- Stop cock under stairs/sink
- Re-glaze the front door
- Complete plastering round windows
- Storage cupboard under stairs (inc light with door switch)
- Extractor fans in WC and bathroom

And the other even better news is that we had our pre-start meeting with "Barry" - the guy who is leading the other two projects and he's set up to start on the 7th January - with scaffold going up on the 3rd. The party wall surveys are all done and the "Award" is due to be delivered just after Christmas. Finally the house itself is looking tidy (and secure) - they went through and cleared up before they left. They've done a fab job really.
