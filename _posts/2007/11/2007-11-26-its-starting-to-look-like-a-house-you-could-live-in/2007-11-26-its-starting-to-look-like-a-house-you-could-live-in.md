Shock horror! Some photos below for those who want a quick fix of progress. The house has lights with switches that work and everything! This is a major milestone and makes it come alive for the first time. I can now feel what it's going to actually be like to live there. Nice feeling. Big jobs left are getting the boiler in (it's nearly there) and the heating on - and then the windows and finally then the floors and the fireplace downstairs. The stress is getting to us now - the relentless need to make decisions and get everything ordered at the right time. S has done a sterling job chasing the various suppliers (including actually visiting one of the delinquant ones...). I think we're coping quite well but both of us have "lists of lists" of things to do and chores to run all the time. I managed to get the many copies of the new plans to the surveyer to finally get the party-wall proceedings underway again today - so that is a result too. Here's a few notes, more for us since we're both travelling to the US in the next days.

- In the utility room they need to add plumbing for the washing machine - so far only the sink has plumbing. Where does the waste run?
- The dining room appears to have only one light switch - we need another just inside the main concertina doors from the lounge
- The electrical sockets and switches are all white plastic. This is cool for now but I think the eventual plan will be replace them with brushed steel - only the budget means we should wait!
- We need to arrange a call with the project manager while we're away to check on progress
- Oh yeah, and from here on in the money gets held back until all the snags are fixed

And the next jobs: \* Tim to order worktop for utility room \* Tim to chase surveyor \* S to chase toilets... \* Plan lighting and electicals in the kitchen \* Sort out the concertina doors for the rear of the house \* Plan and purchase for the bathroom in the loft Gas feed finally connected.
