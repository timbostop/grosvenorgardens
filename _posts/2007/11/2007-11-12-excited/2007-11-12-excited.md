I went round the house after work. The builders had gone home for the day. And the house was dark and cold. There's nothing to beat the excitement of wandering the floorboards with a torch, getting to know the shadows, corners and characteristics of the house which I'll one day live in and seeing what progress has been made. Quite a lot has been done today - the downstairs is now starting to come on. The living room has been plastered and the configuration of the dining and utility rooms is now finalised. Old doorways are sealed up, never to be used again and new ones are opened. Currently there's a hold into the outside which will eventually be a window into the side-return, still to come. The bathroom upstairs is taking shape with the structure for the shower pipework and shelf below the window now in place. The bath should go in tomorrow. All in all, pretty exciting. We're now pretty much half way through the refurbishment (loft and side-return still to come). The big jobs left are the central heating (and boiler), the bathroom and utility room fitouts and the flooring, plus the windows.
