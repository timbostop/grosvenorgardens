Progress has been good this week - with the major rooms now all taking shape. The bathroom upstairs is now completely designed and the walls are being constructed as I write. Most of the fixtures and fittings are ordered and on their way too. Most of the piping for the radiators is also completed throughout the house. Now our focus turns to the utility room which will house the boiler and washing machine - because that's a pre-requisite to getting the central heating in and commissioned. So we've done a design and are planning to stock it from Ikea sometime this week.

 Now we're off down the house to install some speaker wire in the living room and make some fireplace decisions.
