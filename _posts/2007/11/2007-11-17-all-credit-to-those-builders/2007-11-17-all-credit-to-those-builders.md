<!-- Broken image reference:
I have to give the builders credit. It was Saturday and I decided to go round when the builders weren't there and try to install some underfloor wiring for the surround sound system in the living room. It's one of those things which you really need to do while the floor is up - otherwise it wrecks your skirting boards. So I spent a couple of hours on my belly, on the dusty floor, trying to pass cables under the floor joists with the help of various bits of wood, tape and wires tied together. Eventually it was all done, but working in the house is cold, dusty and tiring and I only did it for two hours... Those builders work hard. ![](images/photo 031.jpg)
