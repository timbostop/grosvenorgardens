![front-bedroom.jpg](images/front-bedroom.jpg)Peter, our Polish foreman and his team arrive on site tomorrow morning at 8am. With the building company we've commission acting as our "independent" project manager during the process and supposedly making 2-3 visits per week, we are hoping this will be as smooth as can be expected. It's difficult to know what to expect - and also because it's a "one-off", we are also pressurised to succeed. We've done as much preparation as we can - detailed drawings, schedules and designs should mean everything is ready to go. We'll be detailing the day-by-day progress right here.
