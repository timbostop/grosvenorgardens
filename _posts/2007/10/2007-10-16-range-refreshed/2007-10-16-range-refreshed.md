You'll remember the kitchen range which we found hidden behind a load of old cupboards in the kitchen of the old house? A [nice man from Wales came to remove it](http://www.grosvenorgardens.com/2007/09/a_man_from_wales.html) and we sold it to him on eBay Well I'm pleased to say that it's now been restored, lovingly, having had all of it's rivets and screws replaced and retapped and re-painted (currently in primer). What he's going to do with it I'm not sure but I think he just likes restoring these (now quite pretty) things.
