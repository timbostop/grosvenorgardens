So bang on time, 5 chaps turned up on Monday morning at 8am and proceeded to knock seven bells out of the old shack. Only two of them are actually working there this week but they've already made some good progress - stripping out all the old junk and piling it in the garden until a truck arrives at the weekend to get rid of it all. Photos to follow...
