Work has ground to a halt this week as our builders have been dragged off on another job - for no longer than "a few days". We believe this is par for the course and things were going so well. So the house is sitting empty and unloved, with a lot of exposed bricks, a few inserted wall sockets, a new switchboard and a half-boarded ceiling in the two bedrooms on the first floor. We're being philosophical (for now) and have stalled on our payments to them too. Tit for tat, etc. In the meantime we're getting down to the surprisingly difficult tasks of designing the kitchen and bathrooms. Getting there slowly, still a long way to go. Oh and working to get the neighbours to sign their party wall agreements without too much fuss.
