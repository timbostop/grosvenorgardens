![ginger.jpg](images/ginger.jpg) The story behind the really pretty scary ginger mannequin with the red-painted nipples and, frankly, a dodgy looking piece of carpet for a fanny is that the builders found this in our attic. This is pretty worrying. Especially since I told S early on we'd find a "body" in the house. Who the hell made this shocking, primitive "sex toy" I have no idea but I'll be glad when it's been removed. Was this made by the elderly gentleman who owned the property and lived, wifeless for the last few years of his life? Or was it hidden there by his teenage son, made in the 70s? What could possibly explain this surreal "apparition"? And what's with the pyjamas she's only barely wearing? What must the builders think?
