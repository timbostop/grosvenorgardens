We've been working to try to figure out how the rear extension on our house is going to look like. In the planning application the drawings show a 3m extension from the current wall - which is way too big and will completely dwarf the garden. It was put in there because that's the "maximum" and once you have planning permission for the maximum you can then build out up to that maximum. We really just want maybe a 1m or 1.5m extension to give us a large enough kitchen room at the back of the house. We need to decide what the impact of a 1m or 1.5m extension will be on the garden, the neighbours, the kitchen space and what it will actually look like. Here's some mockups: ![Rear-extension-from-top.jpg](images/Rear-extension-from-top.jpg)  The design shown on the plans looks hideous and we need to come up with a better solution if we're not to ruin the whole look of the house from the back.
