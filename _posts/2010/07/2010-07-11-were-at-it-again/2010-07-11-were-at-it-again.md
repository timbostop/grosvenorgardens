With the best summer weather any of us can remember this year, instead of relaxing and enjoying it, we're in full construction mode in the garden.

Earlier in the year the new shed was a major project. Last weekend we re-fenced the chicken pen - in a new configuration which makes our garden look less like a rambling farm.

And this weekend we started on the next big thing: a new deck at the bottom of the garden.

The result should be a 2.5m x 2.5m area which catches the last rays of the sun in the garden and gives a good view back to proudly gaze at the house with a glass of wine.

That's the theory anyway.

At the moment, it's all dig, dig, dig, concreting posts into the ground and screwing big bits of heavy wood together with massive bolts. Hard work.

Hope it's worth it. Photos to follow
