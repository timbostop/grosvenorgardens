The honeymoon we always dreamed of - laying a concrete base for the new cycle shed...

First time I'd laid concrete and it worked out better than expected - though the shed is in a different place to how we'd planned - but better for it.

Bought ready mixed aggregate and cement and mixed it on a tarpaulin with a spade. We did 4 batches of 3 bags to get this lot in and then tamped it down with a wooden block. Now we wait 3 days before it's hard enough to erect the shed on.
