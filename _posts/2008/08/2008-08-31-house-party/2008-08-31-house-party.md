The hen's got a new "hotel" last weekend - we decided to make them a permanent home. So the investment in these egg machines stepped to a new (and frankly ridiculous) level... we already have one "hundred pound hen" - when you count purchase cost and vet bill for the sore leg (which is now much better).

Hopefully the effect is to tidy up the "Gypsie's" garden we've been cultivating recently.

Big news is that, after much build up, one of the hens, Boo, laid her first egg yesterday... and it was a double-yolker. She was clearly possessed by the desire all morning and finally, in the bean patch, announced with much excited clucking that she'd fulfilled her purpose.

We barbequed it at our house party!
