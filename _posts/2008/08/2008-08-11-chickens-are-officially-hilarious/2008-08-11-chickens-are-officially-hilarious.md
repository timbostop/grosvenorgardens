The chickens have developed slightly bolder behaviour today - starting with coming down the ladder of their own accord this morning when the door was opened and ending in indignantly pecking the stick we use to try to chase them down the run so we can catch them... We've named them. Chicken Madras, Chicken Bhuna and Chicken Shashlick. Last night, determined to sleep in the nest box, two of them were snuggled down together in the tight space - even though we'd blocked the entrance. The other was perched on the divider between the nest and sleeping areas. I had to chase them out rudely at 11pm... talk about them ruling us. Anyway, they're great fun. Web cam action coming soon!
