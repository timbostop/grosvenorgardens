*Unfortunately, some images from this post are missing - they were sadly lost during the blog migration.*

Scaffold (a real photo of ours this time)... this is what's known as a "tin-hat" ![](images/photo-canon 030.jpg) I climbed this ladder (bit wobbly) to get these photos: ![](images/photo-canon 019.jpg) The view of the garden from the top: ![](images/photo-canon 018.jpg) And the various aspects of the roof (it's in pretty bad condition): ![](images/photo-canon 003.jpg) ![](images/photo-canon 004.jpg) ![](images/photo-canon 005.jpg) ![](images/photo-canon 008.jpg) ![](images/photo-canon 009.jpg) ![](images/photo-canon 010.jpg) ![](images/photo-canon 014.jpg) ![](images/photo-canon 015.jpg) ![](images/photo-canon 016.jpg) ![](images/photo-canon 021.jpg) ![](images/photo-canon 033.jpg) ![](images/photo-canon 037.jpg) ![](images/photo-canon 039.jpg) The broken clip which lost the scaffold pole which flapped in the wind and damaged our neighbour's... ![](images/photo-canon 001.jpg) Skylight... which is now scratched... ![](images/photo-canon 012.jpg) Oh... and finally we decided it was time for our "friend" to go... last view before we bagged her up. The nightmare is over: ![](images/photo-canon 024.jpg)
