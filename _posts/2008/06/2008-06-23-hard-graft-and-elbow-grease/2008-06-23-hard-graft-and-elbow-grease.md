We spent a rare free weekend working hard in the house - this time without builders present (they're clearly anxious to finish now and discussions into the final payment are well underway).

We did a bunch of jobs - commissioning the alarm, putting up bathroom cabinets, tidying up the shed, cleaning up the kitchen and were still scrubbing the kitchen floor at 9pm on Saturday night (what a life!).

Hope you agree it's now looking fine!
