It's been a week of small jobs. The guys are still on site everyday - finishing the painting and finishing all the small jobs. I reckon one more week and we'll be very close to finished. The small jobs take forever - toilet roll holders, shelves, towel rails, light fittings. And they're being very good and doing what is effectively scope creep for nothing or at least very little. Of course we still have to settle up the final bill. I like that the place smells softly of new carpets and fresh paint. At least the top floor feels clean - the other two are a bit gritty and dusty still. The whole place will need a few weeks of thorough cleaning to get rid of all that dust. The last remaining big job is the decking (an extra we've added) which will finish the garden off nicely. Photos of the various achievements, coming shortly.
