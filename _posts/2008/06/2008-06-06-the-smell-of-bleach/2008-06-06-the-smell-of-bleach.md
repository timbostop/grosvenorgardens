As the moving weekend looms, today saw the house once again full of people - carpenters building shelves, kitchen fitters fitting kitchen, cleaners doing a "deep clean", removal men delivering furniture and me and me dad in the middle of it all, trying to make the house ready.  
  
Mind you it was the first time the place smelt clean - of bleach and cleaning products.  
  
Final move in is Monday next week and this weekend is about crossing the finish line.  
  
Here's a few select photos from the day:
