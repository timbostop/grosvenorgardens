## It's fathers day and I want to pay tribute to my dad.

Here he is, after spending 7 days last week down in London helping us move house. From supervising the builders, fetching us materials, mending things, and making things just right, nothing is too much trouble and he works like a trooper. He made a very stressful thing, more relaxing and brought a calm influence to proceedings by removing the pressure from us. All this for love. And I love him. Thanks Dad - you're amazing and I wouldn't be here without you (in the less than obvious sense). T x
