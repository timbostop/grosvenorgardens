Progress has been slow this week - mainly because it's the end of the job and there are fewer people on site but also because the screed in the kitchen took 3 days to "go off" - and no one could work in there during this period.  
  
Unfortunately someone did walk on it during that period (the project manager) and thinking it hadn't set properly, dug his heels in to see how bad it was. Cue builders getting annoyed again... and a hole which needs patching.

Here is the nice flat kitchen floor:
