We have decking! Peter and Tomasz have been busy over the last three days putting up our decking - the finishing (and hopefully last major item) touch for the garden and the house. It is looking superb now.

  
Alarmed at the height of our decking and the lack of privacy this gives us and our neighbours next door, M (next door) and I decided to put up a new higher fence panel to protect us. Ironically spending a day getting to know each other better on building a barrier between us - but I'm sure it won't get in our way.

  
We aimed to mirror the recently added fence on the other side and so our deck now is symmetrical. We bought the timber posts and featherboard separately and made a custom panel to fit the space. The old fence is exhausted and so ultimately we'll be replacing the whole thing - one panel at a time. All in all a good day's work.

  
S was on BBQ duties as well as oiling the new garden furniture - so by the end of the day we had a "changing room" style transformation of the back of our house.
