We finally got the roofing snags ironed out (and inspected by the party wall surveyor). See the photos below.

It still looks vaguely like our roof was finished by Stevie Wonder - but at least it shouldn't leak now for a bit.

The party wall surveyor said he thought our brickwork "interesting" - the "heavy" pointing style went out of fashion 400 years ago - is what he actually said. He didn't think much to the lead roof either. But neither is too disastrous.

Onwards and upwards.

We now have a carpet man booked in for a couple of weeks time, the kitchen turns up next week, the kitchen floor is being tiled this week and various snags are being knocked off the list.

On the painting front we have finished paint on the top and middle floors and first coats on the lower floor.

And today I booked a move in date for 9th June. Rock on!
