We got back to find quite a lot of progress in the house. We reckon we're about 4-5 weeks away from moving in now (exciting) - and ready to set a date for that move too.

Tomasz the painter has made good progress - the loft is entirely painted and so are all the rooms on the 1st floor. Which leaves only the rest of the hall-stairs-landing and the front reception room to go.

Peter has also built a wardrobe for us in the loft back bedroom which turned out great.

Here's some photos:

Finally the kitchen door gets opened onto the new kitchen:

The back of the house is secured, finally - although we wonder how to actually get out?

Bannisters - this is the lasting legacy of the dodgy crew - the bannisters which don't fit... we're just going to have to live with this one:

Landing painting - looking pretty nice with a two tone effect. The lower half is "wipe-clean" paint which should mean it lasts longer after we move all our junk in:
