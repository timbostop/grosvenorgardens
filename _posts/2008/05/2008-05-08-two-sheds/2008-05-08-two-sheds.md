<!-- Broken image reference:
We were fortunate enough to have my parents (thanks!) come and house sit this week while we were away and both supervise the builders in their progress as well as help by fixing up some stuff we didn't have time to do. I can't tell you how much of a relief it was being away - but knowing that stuff was getting sorted out and handled! Trying to do admin Stateside with a 6 hour time difference and a full time job is worse than impossible. But thanks to their kindness, we now have two sheds - a new one in the front garden which will eventually be our bike shed. It needs some securing (to the ground) but didn't my dad do a good job? ![IMG_1675.JPG](images/IMG_1675.JPG) ![IMG_1677.JPG](images/IMG_1677.JPG) ![IMG_1679.JPG](images/IMG_1679.JPG) ![IMG_1681.JPG](images/IMG_1681.JPG)
