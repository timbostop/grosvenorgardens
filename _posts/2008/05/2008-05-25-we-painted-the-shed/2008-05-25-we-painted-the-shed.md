It may not seem like much but it was significant step in our transforming our tired old house into our fresh and new home. The neighbours tell us that to their knowledge, the shed has received no maintenance in the 10 years they have lived next door. In which case it's amazing the wood is not in bad nick and the felt on the roof is intact. We cleared out the junk lying behind the shed and rubbed the old creosote off it. The rear of the shed has obviously been damp for a while and was hence rotten and woodwormy. We stripped four of the cladding boards and cut out the base of the frame. A trip to Homebase got us some fresh wood and I fashioned a replica of the bit we'd cut out. Although it's not yet finally fitted (I couldn't find and replacement cladding yet), we were quite pleased with the result and the new colour (racing green) is rather fresher. Other plans for the garden include some decking outside the kitchen, a couple of raised beds for vegetables, space for a small chicken coop and possibly a little seating area at the bottom of the garden for catching the final rays of the sun. It's going to be perfect.
