As mentioned below, because of a change in the way the stairs are fitting into the loft and the consequential loss of major head height in the proposed bathroom, we needed to come up with a better solution. This is the original proposed layout (as per our original drawings): 
<div class="single-image" style="margin: 20px 0;">
  <a href="/images/new-loft-bathroom.jpg" target="_blank">
    <img src="/images/new-loft-bathroom.jpg" alt="new-loft-bathroom.jpg" style="max-width: 600px; width: 100%; height: auto;" loading="lazy" />
  </a>
</div>
 Where the bathroom was is now a dressing room - which is kind of a walk-in wardrobe with shelves and shoe racks etc... The new bathroom will be positioned with full head height between the two original bedrooms and has an ensuite entrance from the master bedroom. In addition to the walk-in wardrobe, we also get a fitted wardrobe in the rear guest bedroom and a neat seating area in the master bedroom. There's still room for both the beds AND pretty much a clear line of sight to the Juliette balcony from the master bedroom doors. Finally the bathroom is positioned over the existing soil pipe so we won't need a macerator and the plumbing will be easier. Now just got to persuade the builders this is a good idea.
