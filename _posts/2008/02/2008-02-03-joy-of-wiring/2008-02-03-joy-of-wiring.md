Trying to work out the various ways in which the house now needs wiring up. First, I need a phone line (we don't use it for calls but we do need it for broadband). I think the previous owner had NTL cable but all the connections have gone - so I think we need a new BT line installing. Other than wondering exactly where the BT engineer will be wanting to connect the master socket - here's some [reference instructions on how to wire everything up](http://www.wppltd.demon.co.uk/WPP/Wiring/UK_telephone/uk_telephone.html) I will be trying to get the [cheapest setup](http://forums.moneysavingexpert.com/showpost.html?p=1598074&postcount=3) from BT. And then adding a chosen broadband supplier (prob not BT) on top. From BT "Do I need a new line" - If you are unsure, phone us on 0800 800 150 (Monday to Saturday 08:00 - 20:00) and we will be able to look at our records for your property and confirm if a new line is required.
