It's been a while since the last update (stag dos, busy working schedules and hectic activities have conspired against us). Having said that the builders have been thankfully busy as well - and aside from a bill for some extras to swallow, things are going pretty well.  
  
Our new bathroom design has worked out really well and the loft rooms are all pretty much there now - including plastering, doors, windows and the all-important roof.  
  
You can see from the photos below that the roofers have done a very neat job - especially with all the lead-work around the windows and with the tiles on the "rear box".  
  
All that is left now is to fit the electrical sockets and lights and connect up the plumbing. Then the bathroom fitting etc.  
  
We ordered all the tiles today (for both bathrooms and the utility room) and they should be on site Monday.  
  
So everything is gunning for finishing the loft extension in the next week or so.  
  
Meanwhile, we commenced the rear-extension project too and work on that (digging foundations) begins on Monday in parallel. Finally we sorted out a quote for the carpet today and are getting quotes for decoration.  
  
Increasingly we need to get to grips with moving in in April or so - a very exciting prospect.  
  
Here's some photos of the progress:
