Other than the site being really dirty (see previous post) progress has been good again this week. The steels are in and the back of the house now doesn't look like it's being suspended magically in mid-air.  
  
The clever steels are connected in such a way that the building can be supported without needing any unsightly pillars/columns inside the kitchen.  
  
Now just need to brick back up the holes, remove the props and then put the side-return roof on. Can't wait.  
  

Acro props still essential:

These are the "goalposts" which are supporting the weight of the floors above down the side of the patio doors:

Complicated joints designed to make sure there are no visible pillars in the kitchen (finally). This design took three iterations to get right:![](images/photo-canon%20033.jpg)

Bolting together nicely:

And the padstone:
