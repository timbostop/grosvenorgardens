We've been away for a few days and fortunately returned to find progress has been good.  
  
The beginnings of the sloping side-return roof (which will hold 4 veluxes) was going in yesterday, as well as the "concrete slab and beam" floor.  
  
The steels are in place and the walls above them have been bricked in - so hopefully by the end of this weekend, most of the brick work will be completed.  
  
Elsewhere the house has been tidied up and feathers smoothed (a little). I don't think we're out of the woods entirely but our point has been made.  
  
Painters began working on the front of the house (filling the windows etc) and also doing the diluted emulsion base-coat on the walls in the front bedroom. So it really will start feeling like home soon.

"Soldiers" above the door, now in the right place. This rear wall will have a "paraphet" top which hides the short flat roof behind it.

Juliette balcony above is finally fitted and looking nice.

Putting the bricks in:

The match with the old wall is pretty good - all the bricks have been reused from the dismantled walls/chimney breasts:

These are the concrete beams for the kitchen floor:

The interior steels - now nicely out of the way of the kitchen space - and it feels very spacious as a result.

Footings for the steel "goalposts" now in place. The blocks at the bottom of the wall are where the floor beams rest on:
