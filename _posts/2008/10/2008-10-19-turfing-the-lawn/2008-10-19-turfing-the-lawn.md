We got down to a seriously hard days work yesterday. We started at 9am digging the lawn, moving the chicken coop, raking and heeling, raking and heeling until the soil was flat and clear enough to lay the turf at around 4.30pm. All done by 6pm, exhausted. Looks like a golf course... ![](images/photo-canon 001.jpg) ![](images/photo-canon 003.jpg) ![](images/photo-canon 006.jpg) ![](images/photo-canon 008.jpg) ![](images/photo-canon 011.jpg) ![](images/photo-canon 014.jpg) ![](images/photo-canon 019.jpg) ![](images/photo-canon 022.jpg) ![](images/photo-canon 023.jpg) ![](images/photo-canon 025.jpg) ![](images/photo-canon 027.jpg) ![](images/photo-canon 029.jpg) ![](images/photo-canon 031.jpg) ![](images/photo-canon 033.jpg)
