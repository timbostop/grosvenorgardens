We got a new blender. You can make a nice thai ginger soup like this:

- 500 ml water
- stock cube
- stick of celery
- slice of cabbage
- slice of carrot
- tomato
- spinach - handful
- slice of raw ginger
- 2 cloves of garlic
- 2 handfuls of cashew nuts
- 1 pepper sliced
- 1 slice of chilli
- 1 slice of lemon with peel on
- 1/4 of an apple

Whiz it up and leave running for 6-7 minutes until steaming.

Hot, raw, tasty soup
