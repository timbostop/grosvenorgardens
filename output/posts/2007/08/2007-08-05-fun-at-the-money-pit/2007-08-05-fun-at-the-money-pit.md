So our house comes with some nice things: ![photo-277.jpg](images/photo-277.jpg) and some fairly horrible things: ![photo-196.jpg](images/photo-196.jpg) But we went there this morning to measure up properly and take photos of everything for the "before" pictures. But we found some things we weren't expecting: Behind this old battered looking cupboard, full of betamax videos: ![photo-002.jpg](images/photo-002.jpg) we found what, at first, we thought was a postbox with the word Lambeth on it, ![photo-011.jpg](images/photo-011.jpg) but turned out to be the original Victoria (or is it Edwardian?) cast-iron range cooker: ![photo-007.jpg](images/photo-007.jpg) which is one period feature we won't be keeping in the house, but perhaps someone on ebay might want it. Amazing. Also, behind this horrible 70's electric bar fire, ![photo-026.jpg](images/photo-026.jpg) was another original fireplace, in need of some love: ![photo-028.jpg](images/photo-028.jpg)
