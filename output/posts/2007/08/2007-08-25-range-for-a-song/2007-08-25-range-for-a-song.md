We don't know if we sold it for a song or not, but we managed to get our range sold to a nice man in Wales for £120. Most importantly, he'll be coming round to extract it from the house (which could have cost us £100 itself). So all is good with the world. Can't help feeling that maybe we could have got more for it - on ebay we had surprisingly high number of "watchers" it's just it didn't turn into the bidding frenzy we'd expected. Then again, it is just a big block of cast-iron after all. We've also arranged for National Grid to come and put us in a new gas supply (the house doesn't have one) - so things are starting to happen. And we have our surveyor coming round today to start the drawing/planning process once and for all. Apparently we expect the drawings to go into the council n the next couple of weeks. And the "boys" who'll strip the house back to it's bare bones are starting mid-September still, led by a nice Polish chap called Val. Val seems optomistic about a around-Christmas completion date for the building works (not the decorating) so this gives us hope we might not be waiting as long as we thought. Here's hoping.
