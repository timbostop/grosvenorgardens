Progress next door is swift currently - they're working on the bathroom and now some of the downstairs rooms. Amazingly most of the first floor is plastered, fully wired and just waiting for the central heating! We have the start of a really nice new brick fireplace in the dining room - re-using some of the bricks taken from the two chimney stacks. It's a great idea to fill the void where the range was and will make a real feature of that room. Elsewhere the downstairs loo is taking shape as definitely the smallest room in the house. Comedy moment was three Polish builders in there measuring exactly the distance needed for a man to stand back from the toilet in order to successfully deliver wee into a toilet. Hilarious!
