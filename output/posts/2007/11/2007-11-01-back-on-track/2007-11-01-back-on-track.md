The builders, an increased team of 5, have been back on site this week and made a remarkable amount of progress. Two of the rooms upstairs are almost totally plastered and starting to look great. They aim to finish the whole 1st floor in the next three days. Of course, there's still a lot of work to do - although the electrics are mostly in, the central heating and plumbing is still to be done. The utility room design is next as this will allow them to confirm the boiler placement, install it and then roll out the radiator installation. After that comes the window replacement and then the more major structural work downstairs. In the meantime the bathroom design needs to be nailed down and ordered. All good fun.
