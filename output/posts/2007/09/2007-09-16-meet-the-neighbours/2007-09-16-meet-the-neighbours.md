We consider ourselves very lucky that we seem to have great neighbours in our new house. M and A on one side with their three young boys and J and J on the other with a boy and girl. We went to meet J and J for a drink on Friday night and got on so well that we stayed for four bottles. Next morning it felt like we'd been poisoned but we have resolved the party-wall decisions one needs to get right with new neighbours and found out a ton about the local residents, what the previous owners of our house were like and got another set of lessons in how to renovate these houses. Can't wait, basically, to actually live there so we can enjoy the community even more.
