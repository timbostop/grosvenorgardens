Here's a few highlights as the kitchen nears completion:

  
Shed - now with 4 new panels to replace the rotten ones:

And painted, one coat:

Hopefully a bit more waterproof:

And the dining room too:

Island units, now with handles and sink  - it's also been measured for Corian worktop - which comes in three weeks:

And under:

In-built socket (in the cupboard wall to allow for glass splashback to come later on the back wall):

And the neat back of the socket:

Big fridge - should be room for enough vegetables in there:

Spanners in the works?

And the grouting on the floor in the loft bathroom is finished finally:
