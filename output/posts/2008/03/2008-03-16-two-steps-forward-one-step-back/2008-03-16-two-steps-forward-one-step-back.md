We've seen some good progress this week on tiling in the utility room and 1st floor bathroom - those are getting close now.

Also we seem finally to have sorted out the mess at the back and now most of the walls have come out - leaving only a pillar which will be removed when finally the steels are on site.

We're probably delayed 1 week as a result of all the cockups - and now hopefully back on track.

Kitchen design continues to play on the mind - we'll get it right.
