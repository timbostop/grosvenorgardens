Well, we finally succumbed. We are the proud owners of 3 baby-replacement chickens.

These girls are not going to be joining Mensa anytime soon. We put them in their new Eglu Cube - purposely designed for happy chickens - and they couldn't figure out how to go up the ladder to bed. In the morning, after opening the door, it took an hour of delay and some shooing to get them to come down the ladder again. And another hour of coaxing and teaching before they figured out how to get water from the "glug" container.

Highly entertaining though - now convinced I have to get a camera installed in the nest so we can watch them sleep...

We have:

1 Bovan Nera (black with copper breast)

1 Belle Blue (grey all over)

1 Speckledy (black with white speckles)

No names just yet - waiting for them to appeal
