We're just two weeks away from our moving in weekend now. Sometimes it feels like we're really close and other times, so far away. But in truth I think we will be ready to move in then.

The carpets are laid now - took three guys just 5 hours to lay two floors of carpet and underlay. And so, apart from some wardrobes being built in to the loft, and some snags in the two bathrooms, the top two floors of the house are, to-all-intents-and-purposes done. Seems amazing.

Downstairs, the paint is mostly there and the kitchen is a work in progress.

The lovely Peter (Polish) is our main man on site, although he had to rush to Poland the other night to see his dying mother. He is supervised competently by Val - the sole reason we still like More Space because he is willing to look after us.

Here's some photos:
