We're still stepping, slowly, towards an inevitable move in date. Whether we'll be "builder free" at the point of moving in - or whether there will still be work to do, is difficult to figure out. Peter had to return to Poland for a bit which was a shame as far as progress is concerned. Hopefully he's back on site tomorrow - otherwise we will be stuck.  
  
We still need the kitchen done.  
  
On the plus side the new appliances turned up today and it will be possible to finish the work before we move in if they knuckle down now.  
  
I got down and dirty and carpeted the storage area neatly: (first time carpeting for me)

New bike fits in new shed (now with more suitable internal and external bolts):

Our garden shed, now neatly painted:

Inside the dressing room, the new shelves and boxed areas are done and painted:

They matched our diagrams nicely:
