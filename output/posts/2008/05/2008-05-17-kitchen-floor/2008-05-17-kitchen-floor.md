Exciting times. Today was Saturday and we were round the house most of the day tinkering with the burglar alarm and buying door furniture for the front door.  
  
The (green) thermal paint on the kitchen floor is now dry and the underfloor heating cable went down today. Once it was secured, it was time for the (big, cream) kitchen tiles to get measured up.  

First tile to get the level and the position:
