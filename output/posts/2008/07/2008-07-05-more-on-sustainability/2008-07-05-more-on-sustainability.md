I came across some interesting material on various topics including [packaging](http://www.riverfordenvironment.co.uk/Packaging.aspx) (did you know paper bags are several times worse from a carbon-footprint perspective than oil-based plastic bags in food packaging?) and [local vs road-hauled food](http://www.riverfordenvironment.co.uk/Farmtodoor.aspx). One of the key issues is that:

> the debate on environmental issues is moving fast but is too often guided by the need to gain marketing advantage rather than deliver genuine benefit. As a result too much effort, in both business and government, is put into doing what customers and voters expect and not enough into rigorously researched long term solutions.

Fascinating re: [tomatoes](http://www.riverfordenvironment.co.uk/hothouse.aspx)... if you just ate these in season you'd only have them in August and September.
