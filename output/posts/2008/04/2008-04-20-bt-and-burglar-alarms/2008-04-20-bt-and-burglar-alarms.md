We spent an interesting day in the house wiring it for telephone and the alarm. We thought the phone system was just broken until we realised (a) that builders had used alarm wire for some of the phone sockets and phone wire for some of the alarm points and (b) had wired the telephone sockets wrongly anyway. Once these problems were corrected and a bit of detective work on the old BT colour codes, we had it cracked and now have working telephone sockets in four of the rooms. Ironically neither S or myself like having a phone at home - we don't like it ringing, use our mobiles anyway and the only people who do ring seem to be salespeople. Regardless, the telephone lines will allow some flexibility in the positioning of broadband etc. We also fixed two of the PIR sensors on the wall in the bedrooms - hopefully in suitable places to protect the place. It's amazing how much time each of these apparently simple tasks take - but each one is a step towards moving in....
