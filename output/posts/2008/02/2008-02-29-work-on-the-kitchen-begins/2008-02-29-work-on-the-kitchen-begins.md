On account of having to travel to the US for a week, The building project is in the more-than capable hands of an increasingly stressed-out S.  What I really miss is being able to keep in touch with progress and watch every stage of the process with fascination. The project is going extremely well (as far as is possible to ascertain from the physical product and with an untrained eye) but it's pushing both of us to the edge in terms of the toll it takes on our spare time and the stressing over the details, decisions and orders which have to be made in almost constant sequence. The other thing is that although the builders are generally willing to do as we ask, they're forgetful and they don't take notes. Time and again we emphasise something - this door needs to open like this, please install the spotlights we've purchased, please use this type of door handle - only to find that a few days later the opposite (or worse) is being implemented and S (who is normally the one on site during the working day) has to correct the decision.  
  
Progress has still been great.  
  
Work began on the rear kitchen extension. There is still quite a lot of "completion detail" (snags) to be finished in the house which we have to get on to quickly. But nevertheless, we continue to get closer to a move in date.
