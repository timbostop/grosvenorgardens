Writing this post on 11th November, a few days after we got engaged in Baden-Baden in Germany on holiday.

We're keeping it secret for now - because there's not much time to be thinking about actually getting married due to lots of career-related nonsense going on plus we're both a bit squeamish about announcing it very publically with all the pressure which comes with it.

We've discussed a "community wedding" where we announce our engagement and then suggest that our friends help us organise a wedding in just 2 weeks time and at short notice. thinking being that it would be well remembered as well as being with people who really care. Another alternative is a very small affair with just a few witnesses.

We're both a bit jaded from the millions of weddings we've been to over the last 10 years - and don't want ours to be the last in a long line of similar also-rans... Plus we're honestly more interested in the 50 years which follow the wedding day than the day itself.

Anyway, as to the engagement: we had a lovely walk (in the rain) kicking autumn leaves in the hills surrounding Baden Baden. Then returning to the view, as we made our way downwards, I popped the question. "Will you marry me?".

"Are you asking?" was the immediate response. Followed by "Can I have a fisherman's friend? I'm a bit anxious...". "Do you really want to? And why do you want to change our happy drifting situation?" featured in the conversation before I finally got a "Oh, that's a yes, by the way". Nothing else would have surprised me from the Powellster.

The ring fitted and was liked. So mission accomplished. Now we have to decide how to do the deed.
