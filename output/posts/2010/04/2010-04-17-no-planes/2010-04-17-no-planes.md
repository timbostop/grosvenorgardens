I use London's airports regularly and frequently and despite trying my best to be environmentally friendly I normally have to side in favour of plans to increase capacity for planes in the future - otherwise I'd be being hypocritical.

I also live under the Heathrow flight path and similarly prefer not to hypocritically condemn the flight noise when I know I use those noisy services myself...

...but the ash cloud from the Icelandic volcano eruption which is currently preventing all air traffic in the UK today and possibly for the next week or so and it's resulting silence in the garden is surprisingly nice - like it's "so quiet" you can hear the birds.

Since I don't need to travel anywhere any time soon, I'm enjoying the treat.
