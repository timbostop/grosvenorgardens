Yes, Spring has sprung. After what seems like a very long, cold, damp winter in the UK the spring has finally arrived.

I'd almost forgotten what it is like - watering the plants in the evenings after work, cycling home when it's light, watching the chickens happily bathing in the sunlight and drying out and cleaning up their feathers (harder in the winter). The difference in the garden in just a few weeks is incredible - shoots and green things arriving everywhere you look.

We came through the winter a little worse for wear - poor old Shilpa, the last remaining ginger chicken, carked it from some mystery disease which we think might have been peritonitis. So we're down to three: Chicken Bhuna, Chicken Madras and Kulfi and have a 50% success rate so far.

Now our plans turn to a proper garden redesign and we've ordered a new shed as a starter for that. Lots more planning to do.
