The view from our tent in camp, first day in the Serengeti this trip. Last night we stayed with Jo and Jean our friends and safari guides in their amazing house come school in Arusha. This morning we got a flight on a twin otter from then to Karatonga air strip.

Already seen tons of wildebeest, a group of elephants, many hippos and lots of birds. the rain has been early this year so everything is green and lush.

A week long walking and camping safari awaits. Nothing can describe the majesty of the Serengeti - even having seen it several times before it's always better than you remember it. We're very lucky to be here and very much looking forward to it.
