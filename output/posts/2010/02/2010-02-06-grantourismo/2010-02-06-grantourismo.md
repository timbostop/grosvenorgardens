Check this out for a cushy job: Two travel writers get paid to travel around the world for the next year, staying in holiday rentals of their choice, writing about their various experiences whilst also writing their own books and taking other travel commissions.

They're writing about their adventures at [http://grantourismotravels.com/](http://grantourismotravels.com/)

The idea sounds very glamourous - especially since Lara and Terence have been "on the road" as travel journalists for the last 4 or 5 years and probably deserve an end to the endless hotels. Even though they'll be staying in a different holiday rental every two weeks or so, at least they get a place of their own to call home and can cook in their own kitchen.

It's an interesting way to make a living whilst travelling anyway - although it's no cakewalk either - they have to do a lot of writing and clearly [carry a lot of gear](http://grantourismotravels.com/2010/01/19/technology-and-the-art-of-location-independence/) too.

What I like about Lara and Terence is how they've written about how they go about organising themselves as well as their experiences and what it's like to be doing the project.

\[Disclosure: I work for the company which commissioned these writers. And I'm secretly envious of their gig.\]
