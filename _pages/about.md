We started this blog when we undertook the renovation of a terraced house in London - it records the highs and lows of that project. 
After that it was more about the good life - growing stuff in the garden and keeping our chickens.

Until children came along and I stopped blogging.

Keeping it for posterity.

Hope it makes you smile.
